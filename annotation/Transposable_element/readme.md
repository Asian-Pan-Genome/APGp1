##  Repeat & Transposable Element Annotation

Repeat and transposable elements were identified using **RepeatMasker (v4.1.2)** with the **Dfam (v3.3)** database. The analysis was run in sensitive mode (`-s`) with the human species library and the RMBlast search engine:


**Command:**

```bash
repeatmasker \
  -species human \
  -e rmblast \
  -s \
  -pa 30 \
  $fullfa \
  -html -gff \
  -dir $outdir
```
